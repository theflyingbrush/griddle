### Grid

An app to help keep drawings from source photos in proportion.

Upload an image, and set the drawing target size. The photo and the target should be in the same proportion! So, e.g., if your image is 1000px x 1000px your target surface (paper, canvas etc) should be square too. If your target is A4 (210mm x 297mm) then your source image should be a multiple of that size also.

Place markers, and the app will show you the location on your target.

You'll figure it out.
